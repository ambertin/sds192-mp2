### Loading The Data

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

Questions to consider:

How does the size of donations affect the election rate between incumbent/challenger, democrat/republican, house/senate?

Which committees consistently fund republican/democratic candidates?

Which committees see their candidates with the highest election success rates?
