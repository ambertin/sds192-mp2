### Loading The Data

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
load("individuals.rda")
```

### Join committees and individual donations to get a list of all donations to each committee
```{r}

donations_to_committees <- committees %>% 
  inner_join(individuals, by = "cmte_id") %>%
  select(cmte_id, cmte_name, cmte_party_affiliation, occupation, transaction_amt)

```


### Create a list of occupations and order them by number so that we can find some popular occupations of different salaries
```{r}
occupations <- donations_to_committees %>%
  select(occupation) %>%
  group_by(occupation) %>%
  summarize(num = n())

```


### Select some jobs to consider for studying
```{r}

jobs <- c("REGISTERED NURSE", "TEACHER", "SOCIAL WORKER", "FARMER", "CONSTRUCTION", "RANCHER", "REAL ESTATE", "ACCOUNTANT", "SOFTWARE ENGINEER", "MARKETING", "CONSULTANT", "CONTRACTOR", "CEO", "LAWYER", "EXECUTIVE", "PRESIDENT", "DOCTOR", "ANESTHESIOLOGIST")

```

### Calculate the size of donations for each of these occupations

```{r}

occupation_donations <- function(job) {
  donations_to_committees %>%
  filter(occupation == job) %>%
  group_by(occupation) %>%
  summarize(total_donated = sum(transaction_amt), avg_donated = mean(transaction_amt), median_donation = median(transaction_amt), num_donations = n())

}

donations_by_occupations <- lapply(jobs, FUN = occupation_donations) %>% bind_rows()

```
